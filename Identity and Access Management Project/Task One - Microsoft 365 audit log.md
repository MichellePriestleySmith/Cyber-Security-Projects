# Task One

<h2>Objective</h2>

This task focused on the configuration of the Microsoft 365 audit log, emphasising the activation of a feature not typically enabled by default in lab environments. The primary aim was to gain practical experience in initiating and validating the status of the audit logâ€”a vital tool for tracking user activities and obtaining insights into policies and analytics within Microsoft 365.
<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Procedure</h2> 

To ensure a hands-on understanding of enabling the audit log in Microsoft 365, I commenced by launching Microsoft Edge and navigating to admin.microsoft.com. Using my admin credentials, I accessed the Microsoft 365 admin center and selected "Show all" from the left navigation pane, directing me to the Compliance admin center. Within this center, I navigated to the Audit functionality within the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. <br/>
Once on the "New Search" tab, I patiently waited for 2-3 minutes on the Audit page. If auditing was not enabled, a prominent blue bar appeared, prompting me to commence recording user and admin activities. I followed the prompt, making necessary updates to organisation settings if required. Successful activation was confirmed when the blue bar disappeared. <br/>
To verify the efficacy of the setup, I returned to the home page of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal and signed out of Microsoft 365. This process ensures the activation of the audit log capability, facilitating the tracking of user and admin activities for compliance and insightful analysis.
