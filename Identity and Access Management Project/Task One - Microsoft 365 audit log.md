<h3>Enabling the Audit log</h3>

This task aimed to provide hands-on experience in enabling the audit log in Microsoft 365. It emphasized the importance of this feature for tracking user and admin activities, enabling insights for policies and analytics within the Microsoft 365 environment.


To initiate the setup, I opened Microsoft Edge and navigated to admin.microsoft.com, where I signed in using my admin credentials. 
After accessing the Microsoft 365 admin center, I selected "Show all" from the left navigation pane and proceeded to the Compliance admin center. 
From there, I accessed the Audit functionality within the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.

Upon verifying the selection of the "New Search" tab, I waited for 2-3 minutes on the Audit page. 
If auditing was not enabled, a blue bar appeared at the top, prompting me to start recording user and admin activity. 
I followed this prompt, confirming updates to organization settings if necessary. Once auditing was enabled, the blue bar disappeared.

To confirm the successful setup, I returned to the home page of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal and signed out of Microsoft 365. 
This setup ensures that the audit log capability is activated, allowing for the tracking of user and admin activities for insights and compliance purposes.
