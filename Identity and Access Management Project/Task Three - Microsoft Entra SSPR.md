# Task Three

<h1>Microsoft Entra self-service password reset</h1>

This Microsoft Entra Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) task focused on enabling and configuring the SSPR feature in Microsoft 365. 
Admins walked through the setup of SSPR, added a user to the SSPR security group, and assumed the role of a user to experience the registration and password reset processes. 
The lab also covered the admin's perspective on viewing audit logs and usage & insights data associated with SSPR. 
</br> 
</br>
 
<h2>Part one</h2>

This task aimed to provide admins with an understanding of the available configuration settings for SSPR. </br>
It covered aspects such as group settings, authentication methods, registration requirements, and notification preferences, preparing for subsequent user and admin activities.
</br>

I started this Task by accessing the admin center via Microsoft Edge, logged in with admin credentials, and navigated to Password reset settings.
There, I configured self-service password reset properties, including group settings, authentication methods, registration requirements, and notification preferences. </br>
I also explored audit logs and usage data, gaining insights into security events and user behavior related to password resets. 

By completing this task, I gained insight into the administrative configuration of SSPR settings, laying the foundation for user interactions and password reset processes.
</br> 
</br>

<h2>Part Two</h2>

This task demonstrated the administrative process of adding a user to the SSPR security group, enabling them to utilize the SSPR feature.
</br>

In this task, I simulated managing user access within the Microsoft Entra environment. </br>
Firstly, I accessed the Microsoft Entra Admin Center and navigated to Identity > Groups > All groups, gaining access to the comprehensive list of groups within the system. </br>
Next, I specifically searched for and selected the SSPRSecurityGroupUsers.</br> 
Then, I added the previously created user, Sara Perez, to the SSPR security group, ensuring her inclusion in the designated security parameters.
Finally, I verified the successful addition of Sara Perez to the SSPR security group, ensuring accurate and efficient user management. 
</br>

Completing this task ensured that the user, Sara Perez, is configured to participate in the SSPR process.
</br>
</br>

<h2>Part Three</h2>

in this task I wanted to simulate the user-side experience of registering for SSPR, providing insights into the registration and authentication processes.
</br>

The first thing I did was access the Microsoft 365 login page as Sara Perez. 
After successfully signing in, I navigated through the registration process for self-service password reset, a critical security measure. 
This involved completing steps such as phone authentication or email verification, adding an additional layer of identity verification.</br>
After completing the registration process, I ensured that Sara Perez's account was now equipped with enhanced security features. 
Additionally, I confirmed the default sign-in method to ensure a seamless and secure user experience. 
</br>

This task provided valuable insights into the user's journey during SSPR registration, enhancing my knowledge of user interactions with SSPR.
</br> 
</br>
 
<h2>Part Four</h2>

The purpose of this task was to simulate the user's experience in resetting their password using the SSPR feature.
</br>

In this task I initiated the password reset, prompting the system to guide me through verification steps, which were completed through either mobile phone or email authentication. Following successful verification, I entered a new password and confirmed the reset.</br>
With the reset process finalized, I achieved successful sign-in using the newly established password. 
</br>

This task gave me a hands-on experience with the user-side password reset functionality within SSPR.
</br>
</br>

<h2>Part Five</h2>

In this task I familiarised myself with accessing and analysing audit logs and usage & insights data related to SSPR activities.</br>

Initially, I accessed the admin center and navigated to Password reset > Audit logs, where I reviewed information and available filters to track system activity. 
To ensure comprehensive record-keeping, I downloaded audit logs in both CSV and JSON formats.</br>
Finally I delved into the Usage & insights section, I explored registration and usage data associated with SSPR, providing a detailed overview of system interactions. </br>
</br>

This task provided insights into how admins can monitor and analyse audit logs and usage & insights data associated with SSPR, contributing to overall security awareness.
</br>
</br>

<h3>Concusion</h3>

In this comprehensive set of tasks, I enabled self-service password reset (SSPR), configured relevant settings, added a user to the SSPR security group, and experienced the user-side processes of SSPR registration and password reset. </br>
Additionally, I explored the admin perspective by reviewing audit logs and usage & insights data associated with SSPR activities. </br>
This hands-on experience contributes to a better understanding of SSPR capabilities and administration within the Microsoft Entra environment.
