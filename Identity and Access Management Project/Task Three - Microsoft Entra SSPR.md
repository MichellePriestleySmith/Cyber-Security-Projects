# Task Three

<h1>Microsoft Entra self-service password reset</h1>

This Microsoft Entra Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR) task focused on enabling and configuring the SSPR feature in Microsoft 365. 
Admins walked through the setup of SSPR, added a user to the SSPR security group, and assumed the role of a user to experience the registration and password reset processes. 
The lab also covered the admin's perspective on viewing audit logs and usage & insights data associated with SSPR. 
</br> 
 
<h2>Part one</h2>

This task aimed to provide admins with an understanding of the available configuration settings for SSPR. </br>
It covered aspects such as group settings, authentication methods, registration requirements, and notification preferences, preparing for subsequent user and admin activities.
</br>

I started this Task by accessing the admin center via Microsoft Edge, logged in with admin credentials, and navigated to Password reset settings.
There, I configured self-service password reset properties, including group settings, authentication methods, registration requirements, and notification preferences. </br>
I also explored audit logs and usage data, gaining insights into security events and user behavior related to password resets. 

By completing this task, I gained insight into the administrative configuration of SSPR settings, laying the foundation for user interactions and password reset processes.
</br> 

<h2>Part Two</h2>

This task aimed to demonstrate the administrative process of adding a user to the SSPR security group, enabling them to utilize the SSPR feature.
</br>

In this task, I simulated managing user access within the Microsoft Entra environment. </br>
Firstly, I accessed the Microsoft Entra Admin Center and navigated to Identity > Groups > All groups, gaining access to the comprehensive list of groups within the system. </br>
Next, I specifically searched for and selected the SSPRSecurityGroupUsers.</br> 
Then, I added the previously created user, Sara Perez, to the SSPR security group, ensuring her inclusion in the designated security parameters.
Finally, I verified the successful addition of Sara Perez to the SSPR security group, ensuring accurate and efficient user management. 
</br>

Completing this task ensured that the user, Sara Perez, is configured to participate in the SSPR process.
