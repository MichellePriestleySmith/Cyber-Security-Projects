<h2>Modifying HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy:</h2>
In this part, I modified an intercepted request in Burp Proxy. This allowed me to change the request and see how the site responded. I did this by using some deliberately vulnerable websites. 

I opened the vulnerable site and logged in. The vulnerable site was a shopping site. I selected to view the product details for an item, turned on interception mode, and added the item to the cart.

From the screenshot below, you can see the output results of my adding the item to my cart. Notice how the last line in the Burp Proxy output mentions the item's price. 
(“price = 133700”)

From there, I modified the price of the item. Just by going into Burp Proxy, I clicked and replaced the number “133700” with “1” and forwarded the intercepted traffic.

What does this mean? This means that I was able to change the price of the item from $1337.00 to $0.01. The screenshot below shows the total cost for purchasing the item is $0.01.
