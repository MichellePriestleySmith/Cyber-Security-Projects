<h2>Setting the Target Scope:</h2>
Next, I tested a target scope that allowed me to tell which URLs and hosts to test. This lets me filter out any noise created by the browser and only pay attention to the traffic I specified. 

I visited another vulnerable shopping site and explored the site by clicking on a few product pages to generate HTTP requests.

After generating some requests, I went to the Target Site map to view the different hosts and select the ones I wanted in my target scope. 

The hosts are on the left side of the screenshot. By right-clicking on them, I selected which ones I wanted to be in the target scope.

After that, I filtered out the HTTP history with hosts only from the target scope that I selected.

From there, I was only able to see requests coming in from specific hosts.
