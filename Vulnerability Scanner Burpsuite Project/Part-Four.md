<h2>Re-issuing requests with Burp Repeater:</h2>
In this section, I used Burp Repeater to send requests repeatedly. This allowed me to study the response of a website to different requests without having to individually intercept each one. This tool makes it more effective in scanning for vulnerabilities. 

To send a request to Burp Repeater, I had to send one of the HTTP traffic to the repeater. 

After I selected the HTTP request to the repeater, I was able to resend the same request.

With this tool, I was able to change the raw data of the request. The screenshot below shows the raw data of the request. In the first line, I changed the product ID of the shopping item from “4” to “100”.

Not only that, I was also able to change the Product ID to a string of characters. I tried changing the product ID to “test”. But it returned an error.

This screenshot shows that the website is using the Apache Struts framework and even the version it is using.

In the real world, this is the type of information that helps attackers find vulnerabilities to breach a system.
