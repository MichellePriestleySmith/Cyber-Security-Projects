# Burpsuite Vulnerability Scanner

<h2>Project Summary:</h2>

This comprehensive project focused on establishing a Home Security Operations Center (SOC) Lab, encompassing the setup of various virtual machines and the implementation of security tools. 
<br />

Key components included configuring a pfSense firewall, setting up Active Directory, integrating Windows 2019 Workstations, deploying Sysmon, and implementing CrowdSec for enhanced security measures.

<br />

<h2>Skills Utilised</h2>

- <b>Burp Suite Configuration:</b> Downloading and setting up Burp Suite Community Edition for vulnerability scanning.
- <b>HTTP Traffic Interception:</b> Using Burp Proxy to intercept HTTP requests and responses between the Burp Browser and target server.
- <b>Traffic Modification:</b> Modifying intercepted requests to understand how web applications respond and potentially identify vulnerabilities.
- <b>Target Scope Definition:</b> Testing target scopes to filter and focus on specific URLs and hosts for more efficient vulnerability scanning.
- <b>Burp Repeater Utilisation:</b> Employing Burp Repeater to resend requests systematically, studying website responses for potential vulnerabilities.
- <b>Raw Data Manipulation:</b> Changing the raw data of HTTP requests within Burp Repeater to simulate different scenarios and test web application behaviour.
- <b>Error Analysis:</b> Interpreting errors returned by websites to gather information about the technology stack in use, aiding in vulnerability assessment.
<br />


<h2>Key Learnings</h2>

- <b>Burp Proxy for Intercepting Traffic:</b> Understanding the role of Burp Proxy in capturing and analysing HTTP traffic, a fundamental step in vulnerability scanning.
- <b>Modifying Requests for Analysis:</b> Gaining hands-on experience in modifying intercepted requests to identify vulnerabilities and assess web application security.
- <b>Efficient Target Scoping:</b> Learning how to define target scopes to focus on specific areas of web applications, minimising noise and enhancing scanning effectiveness.
- <b>Systematic Request Resending:</b> Utilising Burp Repeater to systematically resend requests for studying website responses, an essential technique in vulnerability assessment.
- <b>Raw Data Exploration:</b> Modifying raw data within Burp Repeater to simulate different scenarios and test web application behaviour.
- <b>Error Understanding:</b> Interpreting errors returned by websites to gather information about the technology stack in use, providing insights for potential vulnerabilities.

This project enhanced my understanding of web application security by providing practical exposure to Burp Suite as a vulnerability scanner. 
It also taucht me skills in intercepting and modifying HTTP traffic, setting target scopes, and systematically studying website responses for potential vulnerabilities.
