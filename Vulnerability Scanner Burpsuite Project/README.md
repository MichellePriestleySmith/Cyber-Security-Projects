# My First Vulnerability Scanner

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I decided to run a vulnerability scanner for the first time. 
I did this using Burp Suite, a collection of tools for web application security testing commonly used in businesses. 
This project covers intercepting HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy, modifying requests in Burp Proxy, setting the target scope, manually reissuing requests with Burp Repeater, and running my first vulnerability scan.
