<h2>Intercepting HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy:</h2>

Firstly, I downloaded the Community Edition of Burp Suite onto my PC and started it up.
In order to intercept HTTP traffic, I used Burp Proxy. Burp Proxy allows the user to intercept HTTP requests and responses between the Burp Browser and a target server.

I went to the Proxy tab at the top of the Burp Suite dashboard, made sure interception was turned on, and opened up a Burp Browser.

Inside the browser, I tried to visit “https://PortSwigger.net” and noticed that the site did not load. You can see from the screenshot below on the left is the Burp Browser, and on the right is the output I received after trying to visit the website. 

Burp Proxy has actually intercepted the HTTP request by the browser before it could reach the server and printed the request on Burp Proxy, which I can use to analyze and modify. After forwarding the request, I turned off interception mode.

With the Proxy tool, I was actually able to look at the HTTP history and see all the HTTP requests coming in while interception mode was turned off.

This allowed me to visit the website and have a visualization of the interaction between the browser and the server.
