# Part Two

In task one, I designed a phishing email for a phishing simulation.
The results of the simulation have been analysed, and it's evident that certain departments have a higher susceptibility to falling for phishing emails.
<br/>

In task two, I will use the results of the phishing simulation to:

- identify which areas of the business need more awareness about phishing, and

- design and implement the appropriate training for those teams to lower our risk of an attack.
<br/>

<h2>Interpreting the results</h2>
First, I will review the results of the phishing campaign.

This table shows the results and will help me to identify which teams appear to be more likely to fall for a phishing email than others.

- Email open rate = the percentage of people that opened it

- Email click-through rate = the percentage of people that clicked on the link

- Phishing success rate = the percentage of people that clicked the link and inputted some personal information


The percentages shown in the table are based off the total number of staff members who received the email.

For example, if 100 people received the email and 50 people opened it - the email open rate would be 50%.
<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Analysis of the phishing simulation results</h2>
From the results, we can see that the HR & Marketing teams performed poorly in the phishing simulation.

The standard course of action in a phishing simulation is to provide training to the departments that perform poorly in the simulation.
<br/>
<br/>

<h2>Creating a training presentation</h2>

After analysing the results, I created a short presentation to provide some awareness and training materials for the two teams that appear to be most susceptible.

This will help to improve the security awareness of the teams that performed poorly in the campaign.

<br/>
<h3>Below is an example presentation.</h3>

The main takeaway points from this presentation include:

- They use contextual & visual examples of how to spot phishing emails

- The presentation is clear, concise & heavy on the visuals
 
- They provide clear & concise action points
