# The Scenario

In this project, I will be acting as an analyst in a Security Awareness Team for a credit card company.

The Chief Security Officer (CSO) relies on the team to help staff learn how to identify and report security threats.

<br/>
<h2>How do we identify phishing emails?</h2>

Identifying phishing emails requires a careful examination of various elements. Here are some common indicators to recognise a phishing email

- <b>Sender's Email Address:</b>
Phishing emails often use variations or misspellings of legitimate addresses.
- <b>Urgent Language:</b>
 Phishing emails often create a sense of urgency, pressuring recipients to take immediate action.
- <b>Spelling and Grammar:</b>
Poor spelling and grammar are common in phishing emails. Legitimate organizations typically maintain a higher standard of language in their communications.
- <b>Unusual Links:</b>
Phishing emails often use deceptive URLs or redirect to suspicious websites.
- <b>Unexpected Attachments:</b>
	Malicious attachments may contain malware.
- <b>Requests for Personal Information:</b>
	Legitimate organizations rarely request sensitive information via email.
- <b>Unusual Sender Behaviour:</b>
	Cybercriminals may attempt to mimic legitimate communication.

The clues that point to this email not legitimate are;

-The suspicious looking sender email address.

-The poor spelling, grammar & sloppy layout.

<h2>The first task of this project is to create a believable phishing email</h2>

For this task, the manager of the Security Awareness Team has asked me to lead the phishing simulation campaign.

The first step is to create the fake phishing email to use in the simulation.

Now I have identified what an ‘obvious fake’ looks like, I will create an email that is contextual and believable to increase the likelihood of an employee clicking on the phishing link.


<br/>
<h2>Improve the phishing email</h2>

I will now recreate and improve the obvious fake email to make it more believable.
The end goal is to encourage the user to click on the link.

To create a ‘good’ phishing email, you should:

-Add some context at the beginning - make it relevant to a credit card companies employee
-Mask the hyperlink within text
-Use correct spelling and grammar
-Add points of legitimacy
<br/>
There are many ways to attempt this task, as phishing emails come in all shapes & sizes.
Below you'll find one example of an improved phishing email.
