# Building-an-At-Home-SOC-Lab

<h2>Project Summary:</h2>
This comprehensive project focused on establishing a Home Security Operations Center (SOC) Lab, encompassing the setup of various virtual machines and the implementation of security tools. <br />

Key components included configuring a pfSense firewall, setting up Active Directory, integrating Windows 2019 Workstations, deploying Sysmon, and implementing CrowdSec for enhanced security measures.
<br />
<br />

<h2>Skills Utilised</h2>

- <b>Security Infrastructure Setup: </b> Configured and deployed pfSense as a dedicated firewall virtual machine with multiple network adapters, demonstrating proficiency in network security architecture.
- <b>Active Directory Configuration:</b> Installed and configured Windows Server, established Active Directory Domain Services, and integrated BadBlood to simulate a real-world environment with users, groups, OUs, and computers.
- <b>Windows Workstation Integration:</b> Created and configured Windows 2019 Workstations, ensuring connectivity with the pfSense firewall and Active Directory, showcasing skills in network integration and system administration.
- <b>Security Tools Implementation:</b> Deployed Sysmon on Windows machines to enhance security monitoring capabilities, and set up CrowdSec for threat detection and prevention.
- <b>USB Transfer Skills:</b> Overcame challenges posed by restricted internet access in virtual machines by utilizing USB drives for transferring necessary files, demonstrating resourcefulness.
<br />
<br />

<h2>Key Learnings</h2>

- <b>Firewall Configuration:</b> Gained practical experience in configuring and securing network traffic with pfSense, including the setup of WAN, LAN, and DMZ adapters.
- <b>Active Directory Management:</b> Learned the intricacies of configuring Active Directory, creating a new AD Forest, and populating it with simulated users and objects using BadBlood.
- <b><Windows Workstation Integration:/b> Explored the process of integrating Windows 2019 Workstations into the network, ensuring seamless connectivity with the Active Directory domain.
- <b><Security Monitoring with Sysmon:/b> Implemented Sysmon on Windows machines to enhance security monitoring capabilities, learning about event log analysis and system behavior monitoring.
- <b>Threat Detection with CrowdSec:</b> Set up CrowdSec for threat detection on both the server and workstation, gaining insights into real-time security event analysis and prevention measures.
