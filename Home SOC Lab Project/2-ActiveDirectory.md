# Part 2
<h2>Setting up Active Directory:</h2>
Firstly, I downloaded the Windows Server .iso file and configured it into a new virtual machine on VirtualBox. Then, I started up the VM. 
Once installed, I connected to the Admin account. 
From the Server Manager Dashboard, I went to the "Open Network & Internet Settings."

Then, I went to the Desktop Adapter Ethernet Properties, assigned a static IPv4 address, and used the LAN IP address from the pfSense virtual machine as the Default gateway.

After that, I renamed my PC to something easier to use/remember. Once I renamed the PC, I had to restart the VM. From there, I installed Active Directory Domain Services and promoted the Windows Workstation to the domain controller. 
Then, I created a new AD Forest and rebooted the VM.
<br />
<br />
Finally, I downloaded BadBlood onto the AD. BadBlood is a software that fills Active Directory with OS structure and thousands of objects to simulate a real-world environment. 
However, because the virtual network didnâ€™t have wireless access, I had to plug in a USB drive with the software downloaded and transfer it into the VM.
From there, I opened up Powershell as an administrator, went to the folder containing BadBlood (cd command), launched the program, and watched it install.

After the installation, 2500 users, 500 groups, OU, and 100 computers were configured into my Active Directory VM.
