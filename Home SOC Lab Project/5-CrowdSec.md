<h2>Setting up CrowdSec:</h2>
The first step I did was to download the CrowdSec .msi file. This was a little tricky because my virtual machines donâ€™t have access to the internet.
So, I had to download the .msi file onto a USB stick and transfer it over to the VMs.
From there, I launched the CrowdSec setup wizard on both the server (Active Directory VM) and the Windows Workstation.
