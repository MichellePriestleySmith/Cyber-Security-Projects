<h2>Task one</h2>
<h3>Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal Home Page</h3>

In this task, I navigated through the Microsoft Purview compliance portal home page, customising the card view, and the navigation panel. </br>

  1. To begin, I launched Microsoft Edge and entered the URL admin.microsoft.com into the address bar. This allowed me to access the administrative portal for our Microsoft services.
  2. Next, I logged in to the portal using the administrative credentials provided to me. This step was crucial to gain access to administrative functions and settings.
  3. Once logged in, I located and selected the Compliance Centre from the options available in the left navigation pane. This directed me to the Compliance Centre dashboard.
  4. Upon accessing the Compliance Centre dashboard, I scrolled down to review the cards displayed on the home page. These cards provided valuable insights into our organisation's compliance posture and highlighted available solutions.
  5. To tailor the dashboard to our specific needs, I customised the card view by rearranging existing cards and adding new ones as required. This allowed me to focus on the most relevant compliance insights and solutions for our organisation.
  6. Additionally, I customised the navigation panel by selecting and organising desired items according to our preferences. Once satisfied with the changes made, I saved the preferences to ensure they persisted across sessions.</br>

This task facilitated exploration of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal home page, empowering me to customise their view for enhanced insights into compliance metrics and solutions. 
By rearranging cards and adjusting the navigation panel, I optimised the dashboard to align with the compliance management requirements.</br>

<h2>Task Two</h2>
<h3>Compliance Posture through Compliance Manager</h3>

In this task, I utilised the Compliance Manager to assess the organisation's compliance posture and explore improvement actions. </br>

  1. To begin, I accessed the Compliance Manager either by selecting it from the left navigation panel or by clicking on the Compliance Manager card, depending on its availability and visibility in the interface.
  2. Once inside the Compliance Manager, I made sure to select the Overview tab. This tab provided an overview of our compliance scores, highlighted any improvement actions necessary, and showcased the solutions that influenced our compliance score.
  3. After reviewing the overview, I explored the Improvement actions section. Here, I identified specific steps and actions that could help enhance our compliance scores, ensuring that our organisation meets the required standards and regulations.
  4. Upon identifying a relevant improvement action, I selected it to access detailed information and related tabs. This allowed me to delve deeper into the specifics of each action and understand how it could be implemented within our organisation.
  5. I then navigated through various tabs such as Solutions, Assessments, Regulations, and Alerts. Each tab provided valuable insights into different aspects of compliance management, including available solutions, ongoing assessments, relevant regulations, and any alerts that required attention.
  6. Finally, once I had explored the necessary sections within Compliance Manager, I returned to the home page of the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. This ensured that I had completed my review of compliance-related information and could proceed with any necessary actions based on the insights gained. </br>
  
By utilising Compliance Manager, I gained visibility into the organisation's compliance posture, identified improvement actions, and explored various compliance management features. Through navigation and exploration of different tabs within Compliance Manager, I enhanced my understanding of compliance assessment, regulations, and alert management.</br>
