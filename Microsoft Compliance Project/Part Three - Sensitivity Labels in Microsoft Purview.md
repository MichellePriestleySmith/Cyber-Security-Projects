# Sensitivity Labels in Microsoft Purview

<h3>Objective</h3>
This activity delves into the functionalities of sensitivity labels within the Microsoft Purview environment. Users will navigate through the process of creating, configuring, and applying sensitivity labels, along with exploring the impact of these labels on document security and compliance.
</br>
</br>
 
<h2>Task one</h2>
<h3>Explore Sensitivity Labels and Policies</h3>

This task involves understanding sensitivity labels by creating a new label, configuring associated policies, and exploring label management settings. </br>

  1. To start, I entered the URL admin.microsoft.com in the address bar of my web browser. This directed me to the administration portal for Microsoft services.
  2. Once on the admin portal, I signed in using the administrative credentials provided for the Microsoft 365 tenant. This granted me access to the administrative functions and settings.
  3. After signing in, I accessed the Compliance Centre by navigating to it from the options available in the left navigation pane of the admin portal. This allowed me to manage compliance-related tasks and settings.
  4. Within the Compliance Centre, I navigated to the Information Protection section and selected Overview. Here, I addressed any warnings or issues that were displayed, ensuring that our information protection measures were up to standard.
  5. Next, I accessed the Labels section within Information Protection. I selected a preconfigured label that required editing to better suit our organisation's needs.
  6. I then reviewed the label configuration wizard, navigating through its steps to understand the options available for editing the label. However, I made sure not to make any changes at this stage.
  7. Following that, I explored the label policy settings associated with the selected label. I carefully examined each setting to understand its impact but refrained from making any changes to the policies.
  8. After exploring the label policies, I reviewed them to ensure they aligned with the organisation's requirements. If any unintended changes were made, I promptly cancelled them to maintain consistency.
  9. Moving on, I navigated to the Auto-labelling section and initiated the process of creating a new auto-label policy. I followed the provided steps to configure the policy according to our needs.
  10. Once the auto-label policy was configured, I carefully reviewed its settings to ensure they were accurate and aligned with our information protection requirements. Finally, I completed the creation process, ensuring that the new policy was successfully implemented.
</br>

This task provided a comprehensive overview of sensitivity labels, covering label creation, policy configuration, and auto-labelling policy setup. By exploring label management settings, I gained insights into effectively managing sensitivity labels to enhance data security and compliance.

<h2>Task Two</h2>
<h3>Apply Sensitivity Labels to Documents</h3>

In this task, I will apply sensitivity labels to a Microsoft Word document and observe the generated content marking. </br>

  1. Initially, I accessed the Microsoft Purview compliance portal's home page. From there, I navigated to the Word application, which is a part of the Microsoft Office suite of applications commonly used for creating documents.
  2. Upon launching the Word application, I created a new blank document to work with. Within this document, I entered text relevant to the task at hand. This could include any type of content required for demonstration or testing purposes.
  3. After entering the necessary text, I proceeded to save the document with a specific filename. This ensured that the document could be easily identified and retrieved later as needed. The choice of filename may have been based on the content or purpose of the document.
  4. Following the creation and saving of the document, I accessed the Sensitivity option from the top menu bar within the Word application. This allowed me to assign a sensitivity label to the document, indicating its level of sensitivity or confidentiality.
  5. Lastly, to observe the effect of the sensitivity label, I switched to Reading view within the Word application. This view mode displays the document with applied formatting and security features, such as watermarks. By doing so, I could verify that the sensitivity label was correctly applied and that the appropriate watermark was visible within the document. </br>

By applying sensitivity labels to a Word document, I witnessed the practical implementation of label-based document protection. The observation of content marking demonstrated the direct impact of sensitivity labels on document security and classification.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

This activity provided valuable insights into the functionalities of sensitivity labels within the Microsoft Purview environment. 
By navigating through label creation, policy configuration, and document application processes, I gained practical experience in leveraging sensitivity labels to enhance data protection and compliance. This foundational understanding contributes to effective data governance practices and strengthens overall security measures within organisations.
