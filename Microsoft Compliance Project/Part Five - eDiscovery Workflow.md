<h2>Task one</h2>
<h3>Enabling Permissions for Insider Risk Management</h3>

The primary goal of Task 1 is to enable permissions for Insider Risk Management by adding designated users to the Insider Risk Management role group, ensuring access and management of insider risk management features. </br>

  1. Initially, I accessed the administration portal for Microsoft Purview, our platform for managing compliance-related tasks. From there, I specifically directed my attention to the Compliance section, where we oversee various aspects of regulatory adherence and risk management.
  2. Within the Compliance section, I proceeded to navigate to the Roles & Scopes settings under Permissions. This area allows us to define and manage the roles and permissions assigned to different users within our organisation.
  3. Using the search function, I located the specific roles related to insider risk management, an essential aspect of our compliance strategy. Among the available options, I chose Insider Risk Management, which grants users authority in handling internal risk factors.
  4. After selecting Insider Risk Management, I carefully reviewed the role's description to ensure it aligned with our requirements and objectives. Following that, I proceeded to add designated users to the role group, including individuals such as MOD Administrator and Megan Bowen, who possess the necessary expertise and authority to manage insider risk effectively.
  5. Once the users were added to the role group, I confirmed the update to ensure that the changes took effect as intended. This step finalised the process of assigning insider risk management roles to the specified users, enabling them to fulfil their responsibilities in safeguarding our organisation against internal threats. </br>

Task Conclusion: Task 1 involved configuring permissions for Insider Risk Management by adding users to the designated role group. By assigning specific users as Insider Risk Managers, access to insider risk management features within Microsoft Purview was facilitated, ensuring effective management of insider risk.

<h2>Task Two</h2>
<h3>Enabling Audit Log Search Capability</h3>

Task 2 aims to enable the Audit Log Search capability, which is crucial for insider risk management. This task ensures the availability of user insights and activity data for policy enforcement and analytics insights. </br>

  1. Firstly, I logged into the Microsoft 365 compliance portal, the central hub for managing compliance-related tasks within our organisation. From there, I directed my attention to the Audit section, which is crucial for monitoring user and admin activities.
  2. Within the Audit section, I specifically checked the status of Audit Log Search, an essential feature for tracking and reviewing user and admin actions. If it wasn't already enabled, I took the necessary steps to enable it, ensuring comprehensive auditing capabilities were in place.
  3. Following the activation process, I patiently waited for the auditing feature to be fully enabled. This was indicated by the disappearance of a blue bar on the screen, signifying that the necessary configurations were applied and the system was ready for auditing activities.
  4. Once the blue bar vanished, I confirmed that the Audit Log Search feature was successfully activated. This step ensured that our organisation's auditing capabilities were operational, allowing us to effectively monitor and track user and admin activities to maintain compliance with regulatory standards and internal policies.

Task 2 focused on enabling the Audit Log Search capability, essential for capturing user insights and activity data relevant to insider risk management. By ensuring the availability of audit logs, the foundation for effective insider risk monitoring and policy enforcement was established. </br>

<h2>Task Three</h2>
<h3>Configuring Insider Risk Management Settings</h3>

Task 3 involves walking through the settings associated with the Insider Risk Management solution, ensuring familiarity with configuration options essential for effective policy implementation. </br>

  1. To begin, I navigated to the Insider Risk Management settings within the Microsoft Purview compliance portal. This is where we manage and configure various aspects related to insider risk detection and mitigation.
  2. Once within the Insider Risk Management settings, I carefully reviewed and adjusted settings pertaining to privacy preferences, policy indicators, policy timeframes, and intelligent detections. These settings are crucial as they influence how the system detects and responds to potential insider risks within our organisation.
  3. Finally, I took the time to explore additional settings and preview features available within the Insider Risk Management settings. This comprehensive exploration helped me gain a deeper understanding of the capabilities and options available for managing insider risks effectively. It also ensured that we maximise the functionality of the Insider Risk Management solution to safeguard our organisation's sensitive information and assets. </br>

Task 3 provided insights into configuring Insider Risk Management settings, crucial for tailoring policies to organisational needs. By adjusting privacy preferences, defining policy indicators, and exploring detection options, administrators gain the necessary flexibility to address insider risk effectively.

<h2>Task Four</h2>
<h3>Creating an Insider Risk Policy</h3>

The objective of Task 4 is to walk through the settings for creating an insider risk policy, providing an overview of available options and flexibility associated with policy configuration. </br>

  1. To begin, I accessed the Insider Risk Management page within the Microsoft 365 compliance portal. This is where we manage and configure policies to detect and mitigate insider risks within our organisation.
  2. Once on the Insider Risk Management page, I navigated to the Policies tab, where we create and manage insider risk policies. Here, I initiated the process of creating a new policy to address specific risk scenarios and safeguard our sensitive data.
  3. Within the new policy creation interface, I meticulously configured various details to tailor the policy to our organisation's needs. This included selecting an appropriate template, providing a descriptive name and description, specifying users and groups subject to the policy, prioritising content for risk assessment, defining triggers for policy enforcement, and selecting relevant indicators for risk detection.
  4. After configuring all the necessary details, I thoroughly reviewed the policy settings to ensure they align with our compliance requirements and risk management objectives. Once satisfied, I proceeded to submit the policy settings for implementation, thereby activating the policy to detect and mitigate insider risks effectively within our organisation. </br>

Task 4 focused on creating an insider risk policy, highlighting the various options and flexibility available for policy configuration. By defining policy parameters and selecting appropriate settings, administrators can establish proactive measures for identifying and mitigating insider risk within the organisation.
